Replicating the "Illiquidity and stock returns: Cross-section and time-series effects" paper in Python using Iran's Market data.
In this research paper, we demonstrate that as the market's expected illiquidity increases over time, it has a positive impact on the expected excess return of stocks. Furthermore, the expected excess return is indicative of the risk associated with illiquidity, thus complementing the positive cross-sectional relationship between returns and the absence of liquidity.

Additionally, we find that stock returns exhibit a negative correlation with symmetric unexpected illiquidity as time progresses. This unexpected illiquidity is quantified by the criterion of illiquidity, which represents the average ratio of daily absolute stock returns to trading volume in riyals. This information is readily available from the daily stock data series and is applicable over extended periods in most stock markets.

It's worth noting that the impact of a lack of liquidity is more pronounced in the stocks of smaller companies. Consequently, this phenomenon contributes to explaining the changes in their risk profiles over time within the context of time series analysis.
